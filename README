This is the Protosome.
======================

What the Protosome is?
----------------------

It's django+jquery based workbench for adhoc html prototyping.

It is not a production tool, not a finished work.
No, it's just a couple of half-brushed scripts I use in my everyday work.

Who is this "I"?
----------------

My name is Nikolay Yaremko, I design web interfaces on everyday basis.

My approach requires multiple series of HTML prototyping so I eventually come to this simple framework.

You can contact me via LinkedIn: http://linkedin.com/in/mendokusee


Copyrights?
-----------

This is django-based (so you require to checkout Django and place it nearby) python.
  * http://www.djangoproject.com/

I've put some jquery libraries in static/ folder just to make it easier to bootstrap a project.
  * http://jquery.com/

The rest is simple and therefore free to use.




How to setup this?
------------------

You'll need python and django installed to run this at localhost.
Just unfold this package, go to 'app' folder and type './run'.

To setup a remote host you'll need one more file called 'host_settings.py' with contents alike 'settings/hosts.py'.


How to use this?
----------------

Go in 'urls.py' and add controller line according to a name of project you're working on.
For example, 'mail' -- copy the 'i' line and replace 'i' with smth convenient.

Then go in 'templates' folder and create respectfully named folder. In our case, it would me 'mail' again.

Go in that folder and start templating. Results you'll see at http://localhost:8000/mail/filename (w/o extension).

That's it, no more, no less.


Bonus!
------

There is simple wrapper for iPhone html prototyping in folder 'templates/i'.
Use it so:
http://localhost:8000/i/cascade?t1+t2+t3 where t1,t2,t3 are paths to your iphone templates.
Look in 'templates/i' folder for the rest.
