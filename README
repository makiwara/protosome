This is the Protosome.
======================

What the Protosome is?
----------------------

It's django+jquery based workbench for adhoc html prototyping.

It is not a production tool, not a finished work.
No, it's just a couple of half-brushed scripts I use in my everyday work.

Who is this "I"?
----------------

My name is Nikolay Yaremko, I design web interfaces on everyday basis.

My approach requires multiple series of HTML prototyping so I eventually come to this simple framework.

Copyrights?
-----------

This is django-based (so you require to checkout Django and place it nearby) python.
I've put some jquery libraries in static/ folder just to make it easier to bootstrap a project.

The rest is simple and therefore free to use.
